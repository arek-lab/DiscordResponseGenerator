The tricky part is usually whether to migrate existing data or start fresh — if you have production data in Loveable's instance, you'll need pg_dump/restore or the Supabase CLI migration tools, plus careful handling of auth users and RLS policies that won't transfer automatically. Happy to chat in DMs if you need help sorting this out! 🙂"
